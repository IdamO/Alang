####Winner: "Most Innovative/Best Pebble Hack" - HackingEDU, CA
Inspired by fitness tracking bands, Alang is a language tracking tool that provides users, who are living in a foreign environment, a daily grammar mistake summary.

Unlike typing which can give you immediate feedback through text editors, speaking cannot be "auto-corrected". With Alang, all you need to do is go about your day speaking the language you are trying to learn. At the end of the day, you will get a summary showing all the grammatical errors made within certain periods of time.

## Technical details
Alang is composed of two parts: a Pebble app and a web application built using React, Redux, Node, and Socket.io.

Users speak into the Pebble app, written in C, which uses Pebble’s Dictation API for speech-to-text
The Pebble app uses Javascript to send the text to an API and receive corrections. (stretch goal: display these corrections on-device)
The API updates its state in-memory (stretch goal: use Redis or some other persistence) and sends out updates to all connected web clients.

## Next steps
* Display corrections on-device as soon as they are received
* Use a database to store grammar suggestions
* Provide daily / monthly summaries and more helpful tips on mobile application
